      <div class="about-content">
        <div class="about-text">
          <p>Ordained at the age of 24, Father Mario dedicated <strong>33 years</strong> to lecturing in Philosophy and Theology at the university level. In 2015, he answered a deeper calling — to serve the people of Kilifi County.</p>
          <p>He began his mission in <strong>Marafa, Kilifi</strong>, before moving to <strong>Watamu</strong>, where he resides at the Cathedral and devotes his life to uplifting the most vulnerable.</p>
          <p>To date, Father Mario has invested over <strong>KSh 60 million</strong> of his own resources to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Support students with learning materials and fees</li>
            <li>Feed single mothers and their children in Watamu</li>
            <li>Provide physiotherapy for needy children</li>
            <li>Launch a feeding programme at Watamu Primary School — which has significantly increased student attendance</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The teachers and students are deeply grateful for his unwavering presence and generosity.</p>
